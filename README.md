# Kernel Library

## Summary

This is a personal toolbox that implements some algorithms with kernel methods. The idea is for me to implement a few of these algorithms and

## Algorithms to Implement

There a few classes of algorithms that I would like to implement within this package. They include regression, classification, dependence estimation, feature learning, dimensionality reduction/manifold learning, manifold alignment and adjacency matrix construction. I will have some prior code that I would like to work on and there will also be prior code that will be used from other packages that I have implemented. I will cross that bridge when I get there and will not worry too much about that right now.
