"""Kernels and scalable kernel methods for JAX.

``kernellib`` sits between `gaussx <https://github.com/jejjohnson/gaussx>`_
(structured linear operators, solvers, preconditioners) and
`pyrox-gp <https://github.com/jejjohnson/pyrox>`_ (Gaussian-process models
with NumPyro priors). It owns kernel functions and their composition, spectral
densities and feature maps, kernel ridge regression, dependence measures, and
kernel derivatives. Scale is inherited from gaussx: every kernel can be turned
into a gaussx linear operator, and every algorithm here solves through gaussx's
solver strategies.

The package never imports ``numpyro``; the modelling layer above it does.

Everything listed in ``__all__`` is importable straight from the top-level
package.
